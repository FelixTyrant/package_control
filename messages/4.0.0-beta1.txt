Version 4.0.0-beta1 Release Notes (2023/06/10)

  N O T I C E
  ===========

  Requires at least ST3143 (1.0).

  Main focus lies on stability and python 3.8 support.

  Dependencies
  ------------

  Dependencies are now called libraries.

  They are installed to Data/Libs as ordinary python packages.

  Existing managed dependencies are automatically converted.

  Channel/repository scheme v1.0 is no longer supported.

  A channel/repository scheme v4.0.0 is introduced, which allows to specify
  supported python_versions.

            "sublime_text": "*"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }

  Download artefacts specified via "url" key can also be .whl files.
  Parsing and installing "requirements.txt" is however not yet supported.

  For working examples checkout example-channel.json and example-repository.json
  of Package Control Github repository.

  Package Devs
  ------------

  packagecontrol.io does not yet support the new 4.0.0 scheme and thus doesn't ship
  python 3.8 dependencies/libraries.

  Therefore do not upgrade repositories to 4.0.0 scheme,
  which are included in default channel.

  You can however create your own 4.0.0 repository and
  add it via 'Package Control: Add Repository'.
